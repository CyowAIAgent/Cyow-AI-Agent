# CyowGlass
CyowGlass is an AI companion project. Different from traditional AI companions, it uses holographic projection technology and intelligent AI companion system to provide more private and safe role-playing. Users can customize their own AI companions and project them in their own rooms. It allows humans and AI to live together and brings science fiction scenes into reality.
